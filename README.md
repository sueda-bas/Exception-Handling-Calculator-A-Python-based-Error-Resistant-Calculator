# ðŸ§® SafeCalc â€“ Exception Handling Calculator

This project is a Python-based calculator that reads arithmetic expressions from a file, evaluates them, and writes the results or errors to an output file. The program is designed to handle various **exception cases** such as missing files, incorrect formats, and invalid operands.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
- **Exception Handling**: Detects and reports errors like missing files, invalid operators, or incorrect input format.
- **File Input & Output**: Reads expressions from an input file and writes results or errors to an output file.
- **Strict Formatting**: Ensures numerical output is rounded to **two decimal places**.

## ðŸŽ® How It Works
1. Run the program with an input file containing arithmetic expressions.
   ```bash
   python3 calculator.py input.txt output.txt
